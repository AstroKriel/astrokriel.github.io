I am a theoretical and computational astrophysicst working with [**Prof. Mark Kurmholz**](https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~krumholz/) and [**A/Prof. Christoph Federrath**](https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~chfeder/), where broadly my research works to understand how magnetic fields evolve in turbulent environments. I do this by developing theoretical models, as well as running and developing state of the art simulation codes.

For more about my research, visit the [**Research**][1] page or have a look at my [**CV**](/assets/docs/NK_CV.pdf).
