**Welcome to my website!** I am a theoretical and computational astrophysicist interested in the hidden structure of magnetic fields in our Universe. I am a 2nd year PhD student working with [**Prof. Mark Kurmholz**](https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~krumholz/) at the [**Research School for Astronomy and Astrophysics**](https://rsaa.anu.edu.au/) (RSAA), located at The Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra, Australia

Broadly, my research investigates the interplay between magnetic fields and turbulence in the interstellar medium, where I contribute to the development of high-performance, multiphysics simulation codes ([**QUOKKA**](https://github.com/quokka-astro/quokka)) and theoretical models that shed light on fundamental processes like turbulence. By studing these processes, we gain a more detailed understanding of how magnetic fields evolve and ultimately organised in different astrophysical environments.

If you are interested, I encourage you to visit my [**Research**][1] page, or take a look at my [**CV**](/assets/CV.pdf).
