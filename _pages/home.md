**Welcome to my website!** I am a theoretical and computational astrophysicist interested in the hidden structure of magnetic fields in our Universe. I am a 2nd year PhD student working with [**Prof. Mark Kurmholz**](https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~krumholz/) at the [**Research School for Astronomy and Astrophysics**](https://rsaa.anu.edu.au/) (RSAA), located at The Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra, Australia

Broadly, my research investigates the interplay between magnetic fields and turbulence in the interstellar medium, where I contribute to the development of high-performance, multiphysics simulation codes ([**QUOKKA**](https://github.com/quokka-astro/quokka)) and theoretical models that shed light on the fundamental processes that are responsible for growing magnetic fields born in the early Universe to the levels we observe today. By studing these processes, we gain a more detailed understanding of how magnetic fields evolve and ultimately organised in different astrophysical environments.

If you are interested, I encourage you to visit my [**Research**][1] page, or take a look at my [**CV**](/assets/CV.pdf).
