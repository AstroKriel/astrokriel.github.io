Welcome to my website! I am a theoretical and computational astrophysicist interested in uncovering the hidden structure of magnetic fields in our Universe. Currently, I am a 2nd year PhD student working with [**Prof. Mark Kurmholz**](https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~krumholz/) and [**A/Prof. Christoph Federrath**](https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~chfeder/), at the Research School for Astronomy and Astrophysics, at The Australian National University in Canberra, Australia.

Broadly, my research investigates the intricate interplay between magnetic fields and turbulence within the interstellar medium. More specifically, I contribute to the development of [**high-performance, multiphysics simulation codes**](https://github.com/quokka-astro/quokka) which allows us to delve deeper into the depths of these complex phenomena, and gain a more detailed understanding of how magnetic fields ultimately become structured in their environments. Through my research, I also contribute to the development of theoretical models that shed light on fundamental processes, like turbulence, that shapes magnetic fields in our Universe.
