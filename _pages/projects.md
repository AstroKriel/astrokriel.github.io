  title: "Geodesics in 3D Point Clouds"
  excerpt: "The A-star algorithm is a fast and effective searching algorithm. Here I navigate a point cloud that I generated for the gyroid function. Marching cubes gives the surface of the gyroid isosurface (vertices and faces), and a KD-Tree defines how points are connected in space."

  title: "Ray Marching a Mandelbulb"
  excerpt: "Ray marching is an efficient method to rendering simple scenes, like this mandelbulb (a 3D fractal), which has an infinite about of detail hiding on its surface."

  title: "Zoom-in of the Mandelbrot"
  excerpt: "The mandelbrot is the hello world of the fractal world. Here I play around with Blinn-Phong shading for the escape time of the bla."

  excerpt: "Circles on circles on circles! Thats it."

  title: "Solving Chopsticks"
  excerpt: "[Chopsticks](https://informatika.stei.itb.ac.id/~rinaldi.munir/Stmik/2021-2022/Makalah/Makalah-IF2211-Stima-2022-K1%20(56).pdf) is a fun game I learned when I was kid. I brute force this game and show that there are 557 unique game states. Blue and red points indicate that player 1 and 2 won, respectively, and green and yellow indicates that it is these player's turn to make the next move. SInce chopsticks is a periodic game, branches that end without a win indicate that a game would continue on another branch."
