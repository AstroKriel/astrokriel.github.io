intro:
  - excerpt: "The **turbulent dynamo** is a powerful mechanism that exponentially amplifies weak, seed magnetic fields (potentially produced by a Biermann battery, or phase transition in the early Universe) via kinetic motions, and in the present Universe, this mechanism is ultimately responsible for maintaining magnetic fields in the interstellar magnetic fields at the levels we observe today."

  title: "Morphology of Magnetic Structures in Turbulent Dynamos"
  excerpt: "In **Kriel+2023** in prep. (expected Sept. submission) we use new methods for characterising magnetic structures in plasmas, to established a clear relationship between the local morphology of magnetic fields and global flow properties. We show that turbulent, subsonic environments (**top row panels**), like the warm phase of the ISM, for example, produce magnetic fields that form folded structures that concentrate magnetic energy on the smallest scales allowed by dissipation processes. In supersonically-moving (**bottom row panels**) flows, like in the cold phase of the ISM, however, shocks violently reorganise magnetic fields into larger-scale structures associated with denser regions of plasma, which appear to become independent of magnetic dissipation."

  title: "Effect of Compressibility in Turbulent Dynamos"
  excerpt: "In **Beattie+Kriel+2023** in prep. (expected Sept. submission) we explain how compressibility reduces the overall dynamo efficiency (growth rate and saturated energy level) by enabling the exchange of kinetic energy between solenoidal and compressive motions. Compressed regions of plasma can lead to growth in magnetic fields, however, these moments of growth are short-lived (compression is soon followed by dilation), and leaves a net-negative impact on magnetic growth."

#   title: "White Dwarfs with Infrared Excess"
#   excerpt: "For this work, we study images of 300+ white dwarfs, where the images are obtained from
#   Gemini Observatory North/South and Spitzer Space Telescope. By extracting photometry from the image data, we study
#   white dwarfs with infrared excess indicative of an irradiated dust disc, which are formed by the tidal disruption of 
#   extrasolar planetesimals."

#   title: "Emission from Black Hole Event Horizon"
#   excerpt: "This work uses fully three-dimensional and self-consistent general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation fluid models with general-relativistic radiative transfer 
#   to explore how the inclusion of non-thermal component to the synchrotron emissivity in the accretion sheath defined by the hydrodynamical Bernoulli parameter can result in observable large-scale jet emission
#   in the synthetic image. 
#   Refer to [**MSc Thesis**](/assets/docs/GRRT.pdf) for more details."

#   title: "General Relativistic Radiative Transfer - Black Hole Shadows"
#   excerpt: "This work uses general relativistic radiative transfer inverse ray-tracing to investigate how the shape of the black hole shadow can reveal information about the black hole spin and observed orientation.

#   title: "Gravitational Wave Orbital Decay"
#   excerpt: "In this report, we numerically estimate the orbital decay of two bodies in a close binary system due to gravitational waves.
#   This result is consistent with the observed decay rate of a binary pulsar system. We also study the effect further through Fourier decomposition and separating by orbital eccentricity.
#   See [**report**](/assets/docs/CUHK_report.pdf) for more details."
