  title: "Magnetic Structures in Turbulent Dynamos"
  excerpt: "Using our newly developed methods for characterising magnetic field structures in plasmas, we established a clear relationship between the local, small-scale morphology of magnetic fields and the global, large-scale flow properties of the plasma medium. In, the warm phase of the ISM, for example, where turbulent motions are subsonic (**top row panels**), magnetic fields tend to form folded structures that lead to magnetic energy concentrated on the smallest scales allowed by dissipation processes. In the supersonically-moving (**bottom row panels**), cold phase of the ISM, however, shocks violently reorganise magnetic fields into larger-scale structures associated with denser regions of plasma."

#   title: "White Dwarfs with Infrared Excess"
#   excerpt: "For this work, we study images of 300+ white dwarfs, where the images are obtained from
#   Gemini Observatory North/South and Spitzer Space Telescope. By extracting photometry from the image data, we study
#   white dwarfs with infrared excess indicative of an irradiated dust disc, which are formed by the tidal disruption of 
#   extrasolar planetesimals."

#   title: "Emission from Black Hole Event Horizon"
#   excerpt: "This work uses fully three-dimensional and self-consistent general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation fluid models with general-relativistic radiative transfer 
#   to explore how the inclusion of non-thermal component to the synchrotron emissivity in the accretion sheath defined by the hydrodynamical Bernoulli parameter can result in observable large-scale jet emission
#   in the synthetic image. 
#   Refer to [**MSc Thesis**](/assets/docs/GRRT.pdf) for more details."

#   title: "General Relativistic Radiative Transfer - Black Hole Shadows"
#   excerpt: "This work uses general relativistic radiative transfer inverse ray-tracing to investigate how the shape of the black hole shadow can reveal information about the black hole spin and observed orientation.
#   See [**research essay**](/assets/docs/BH_Shadows.pdf) for more details."

#   title: "Gravitational Wave Orbital Decay"
#   excerpt: "In this report, we numerically estimate the orbital decay of two bodies in a close binary system due to gravitational waves.
#   This result is consistent with the observed decay rate of a binary pulsar system. We also study the effect further through Fourier decomposition and separating by orbital eccentricity.
#   See [**report**](/assets/docs/CUHK_report.pdf) for more details."
